Functions and Data
--------------------

Classes
--------
Classes can be defied in scala like in Java

class Rational(x:Int,y:Int){
  def numer = x
  def denom = y
}

Here Rational is a type with a constructor which assigns values to numer and denom.

Objects
-------
Objects in Scala can be created like in Java using the new operator
new Rational(1,2)

A function can be created that takes as Input the Rational types and outputs another Rational type

def addRational(a: Rational,b:Rational) = {
  def numerSum = (a.numer * b.denom) + (b.numer * a.denom)
  def denomSum = a.denom * b.denom
  numerSum.toString + "/" + denomSum.toString
}

Also this function instead of being separate can be written inside the type Rational and then it would
be called as a method

class Rational(x:Int,y:Int){
  def numer = x
  def denom = y

  def sum(that:Rational):Rational = {
    new Rational(numer * that.denom +
      that.numer * denom,denom * that.denom)
  }

  override def toString = numer + "/" + denom
}
