<<We will be using the same example form the previous lecture>>
Operators
---------
If x and y are integers then we can write x + y
but
if r and s are rational numbers then we need to write r.sum(s) which is not very natural.
In Scala we can eleminate this difference as follows

Infix notation
--------------
In sala any method with an operator can be used as an infix operator
r.add(s) can be written as r add s
r.less(s) can be written as r less s

Relaxed Identifiers
-------------------
In Scala operators can be used as identifiers(ie., either as function or method names or variable names)
Alphanumeric Identifiers : Normally identifiers are Alphanumeric meaning that they start with a letter and
are followed by a sequence of letters or numbers.
Symbolic Identifiers : In scala we have Symbolic identifiers which can start with a symbol and are
followed by other operators
'_' counts as a letter
Alphanumeric characters can end in an underscore followed by operators.
For example of valid operators see worksheet.

Precedence
-----------
The precedence of an operator is determined by its first character
Other rules are as in java
