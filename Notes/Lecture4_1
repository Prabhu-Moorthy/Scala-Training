See Lecture4_2 before contuning

Functions as Objects
--------------------
Scala is also a pure Object oriented language.

Like how in Lecture4_2 we saw that primitive types and booleans can be conceptually represented as Scala classes
functions can also be represented as scala Classes. This is not conceptually, but in reality functions
in Scala are represented as scala classes.

For Eg.,
--------
The function type A => B(ie., func A => B) is just an abbrevation for the class
scala.Function[A,B] which is defined as

package Scala
trait Function[A,B]{
    def apply(x:A): B
}

From the above we see that functions are objects with apply methods
