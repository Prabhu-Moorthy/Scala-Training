Blocks and Lexical Scope
------------------------
Blocks
------
A block is delimited by braces
{
val x = f(3)
x * x
}

Lexical Scoping
---------------
Variables inside a block are only visible inside the block
where as variables outside the block are visible inside the block unless they are shadowed by same
name variables inside the block.

Semicolons
-----------
Semicolons are optional in Scala
