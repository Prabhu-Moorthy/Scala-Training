Conditional Expressions
------------------------
if - else
----------
Looks like an if else in jva but in Scala if else is used for expressions not statements.

	For Eg.,)
	---------
	def abs(x:Int) = if(x>0) x else -x
	
Value Definitions
------------------
Similar to Call-by-value evaluation strategy and Call-by-name strategy we have
a Call-by-value value definition and Call-by-name value definition.

So, far we used def 
	For Eg.,
	-------
	def x = 2
	def y = square(x)
	
	this is Call-by-name because the right hand side of the functionis not reduced initially.
	
The Call-by-value alternative is to use val 
	For Eg.,
	--------
	val x = 2
	val y = square(x)

	this translates to y = x * x
	
The difference between def and val becomes aparent when the right hand side does not terminate.
	For Eg.,
	--------
	def loop: Boolean = loop
	
	def x = loop --> nothing will happen, just that loop has been given a new name
	
	where as
	
	val loop: Boolean = loop --> will not terminate
