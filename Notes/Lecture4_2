Pure Object Orientation
-----------------------
A pure object oriented language is one in which every value is an object.
If the language is based on Classes then this means that type if each value is a class.

Booleans and Primitive types in Scala can be represented conceptually by Scala classes.

Pure Booleans
-------------
Conceptually, types in Scala such as Int and Boolean do not receive any special treatment.
They are like any other classes defined in the Scala package.

In scala the type Boolean maps to the JVM's primitive type boolean.

But one can define it as a class from first principle.
