Packages
--------
Classes and Objects are organized as packages like in Java.

Eg.,
----
package pkg1

when we need to import all the classes in a package we need to use pkg1._ instead of pkg1.* like how we use in java.
To import multiple classes in a package we can use curly braces
pkg1.{class1,class2}

Automatic Imports
-----------------
All members of the package Scala
All members of the package java.lang
All members of the singleton object scala.Predef

Earlier in a class we saw the function require which we used
require is from the package scala.Predef
